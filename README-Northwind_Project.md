# Northwind-SQL-Project
MySQL Queries and Tableau Dashboard showcasing interesting and insightful information gathered and aggregated from the Northwind Database. 

Northwind is a database consisting of information pertaining to a worldwide wholesaler that sells speciality foods to retailers all over the world. It contains tables such as Employees, Orders, Order Details, Suppliers, Categories etc. It is rich in information and I have tried to delve into this dataset from different points of views. In my queries (done through MySQL), I have disected the information present by Employees, Products and even Categories of the products. My goal was to think about this about aggregations and statistics that would reveal the most useful information to make impactful decisions going forward. The dashboard was created using Tableau and it revolves around the categories of the speciality food. In terms of dashboard creation, my goal was to build on the skills I obtained during my courses.
